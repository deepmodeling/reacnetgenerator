# The thermal decomposition of CL-20 (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub>)

This tutorial is proposed to develop a Deep Potential for the thermal decomposition of CL-20, perform MD simulations, and then use the ReacNetGenerator to analyze reactions.  

This tutorial introduces the following research article:
Liqun Cao, Jinzhe Zeng, Bo Wang, Tong Zhu, John Z.H. Zhang, Ab Initio Neural Network MD Simulation of Thermal Decomposition of High Energy Material CL-20/TNT, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 2022, 24, 11801â€“11811. DOI: [10.1039/D2CP00710J](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2CP00710J)

## Reference dataset

In this study, a workflow was developed for making reference datasets with DP-GEN program. The details of each module in the workflow are given in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2CP00710J).
You can install DP-GEN program with the tutorial in [DP-GEN](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen). In this example, the input files for DP-GEN program are provided [here](https://github.com/tongzhugroup/NNREAX/blob/cbb5cbf3eb3b89919ee555147427e071c012f37a/cl20/cl20_v1.yaml).

## QM calculation

CP2K package was used for DFT calculation, which can be obtained at [CP2k](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k). PBE-D3 method was employed in this example, because it is generally used for DFT calculation of energetic materials.

## Training of the NN PES

The DeepPot-SE (Deep Potential-Smooth Edition) model was used to train the NN potential by the DeePMD-kit program. Details of this method can be found in [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465518300882).
You can install DeePMD-kit program with the tutorial in [DeePMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit).

## Reactive molecular dynamic simulation

After training, the well-behaved NN PESs can be used for running molecular dynamics simulation by DeePMD-kit program. 

## Analysis by ReacNetGenerator

The trajectory of a single frame can be integrated into [the entire trajectory](https://github.com/tongzhugroup/TRAJREAX/blob/f10a5c2cab77d3f3b659d9dd08256ae7b27c2820/cl20/cl20.lammpstrj), and the format of trajectory here is `dump`. The reaction mechanism can be obtained by the following command:

```sh
reacnetgenerator -i cl20.lammpstrj -a H C N O --type lammpsdumpfile --nohmm
```
