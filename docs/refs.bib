    annote =   {CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane,
             also known as HNIW) is one of the most powerful energetic materials.
             However, its high sensitivity to environmental stimuli greatly reduces
             its safety and severely limits its application. In this work, ab
             initio based neural network potential (NNP) energy surfaces for both
             {\ensuremath{\beta}}-CL-20 and CL-20/TNT co-crystals were constructed.
             To accurately simulate the thermal decomposition processes of these
             two crystal systems, reactive molecular dynamics simulations based on
             the NNPs were performed. Many important intermediate species and their
             associated reaction paths during the decomposition had been identified
             in the simulations and the direct results on detonation temperatures
             of both systems were provided. The simulations also showed clearly
             that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) molecules in the co-crystal act as a
             buffer to slow down the chain reactions triggered by nitrogen dioxide
             and this effect is more significant at lower temperatures.
             Specifically, the addition of TNT molecules in the CL-20/TNT co-
             crystal introduces intermolecular hydrogen bonds between CL-20 and TNT
             molecules in the system, thereby increasing the thermal stability of
             the co-crystal. The current reactive molecular dynamics simulation is
             performed based on the NNP which helps in accelerating the speed of ab
             initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation by more than 3 orders of
             magnitude while preserving the accuracy of density functional theory
             (DFT) calculations. This enabled us to perform longer-time simulations
             at more realistic temperatures that traditional AIMD methods cannot
             achieve. With the advantage of the NNP in its powerful fitting ability
             and transferability, the NNP-based MD simulation can be widely applied
             to energetic material systems.},

             heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive

             complex reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-

          automatically identified from the cartesian coordinates
          of atoms and the hidden Markov model is used to filter
          the trajectory noises which makes the analysis process
          easier and more accurate. The ReacNetGenerator has been
          successfully used to analyze the reactive MD
          trajectories of the combustion of methane and

The neural network potentials (NNP) strike a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency relative to quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations based on classical force fields. Thus, NNP is becoming a powerful tool for studying the structure and function of molecules. In this chapter, we introduce the basic theory of NNP. The construction steps and the usage of NNP are also introduced in detail with the MD simulation of methane combustion as an example. We hope that this chapter can help those readers who are new but interested in entering this field.},

             models are revolutionizing the field of molecular modeling. However,
             although much faster than electronic structure schemes, these models
             suffer from costly computations via deep neural networks to predict
             the energy and atomic forces, resulting in lower running efficiency as
             compared to the typical empirical force fields. Herein, we report a
             model compression scheme for boosting the performance of the Deep
             Potential (DP) model, a deep learning-based PES model. This scheme, we
             call DP Compress, is an efficient postprocessing step after the
             training of DP models (DP Train). DP Compress combines several DP-
             specific compression techniques, which typically speed up DP-based
             molecular dynamics simulations by an order of magnitude faster and
             consume an order of magnitude less memory. We demonstrate that DP
             Compress is sufficiently accurate by testing a variety of physical
             properties of Cu, H2O, and Al-Cu-Mg systems. DP Compress applies to
